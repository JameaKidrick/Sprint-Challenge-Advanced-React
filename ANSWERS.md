- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
`To have more control over our component since using class components allows us to utilize lifecycle methods.`


- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
`ComponentDidMount (cDM)`
  `- Fetches initial data`
  `- Sets up event listeners`
`ComponentDidUpdate (cDU)`
  `- Fetch additional data based on state or props changes`
`ComponentWillUnmount (cWU)`
  `- Clean up cDM`


- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
`Their main purpose is for reusability so the code is DRY`


- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
`It makes sure something works in different edge cases, it surfaces bugs, and forces more coherent code. It also acts as documentation, so when you go back to your code, you understand what your code is already doing.`
